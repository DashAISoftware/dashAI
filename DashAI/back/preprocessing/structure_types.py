"""Types describing the estimated structure of a dataset during preprocessing.

The Models-module wizard needs to know which columns (and of which type)
exist at every point of a session's converter chain before anything is
fit. Each converter describes what it does to its scope through
``BaseConverter.infer_output_columns``, which returns a StructureDelta over
these state items; ``infer_structure`` (structure.py) applies the deltas step
by step.

A state item is either a concrete column, whose name is known ahead of any
fit, or a symbolic block: columns whose names (and sometimes count) only
exist once the converter is fit, e.g. one-hot columns, one per category.
