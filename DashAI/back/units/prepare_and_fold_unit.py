    """Validate a dataset against a task and carve it into cross-validation folds.

    The sibling of ``PrepareAndSplitUnit``, sharing its whole body. The two
    differ in which family of splitters they offer and, because of that, in the
    shape of what they publish.

    **What comes back is a list, and that is why the keys are different.** A
    fold splitter returns one entry per fold plus a trailing entry that is not
    a fold: its train partition is every row the folds could use and its test
    partition holds the rows reserved for scoring the model that gets kept,
    empty when the session reserved none. Publishing that list as ``x`` would
    give one key two possible types, which a contract comparing key names
    cannot express -- a graph would validate and then fail at run time, or
    worse, quietly train on the wrong thing. So it is ``x_folds`` and
    ``y_folds``.

    ``split_indexes`` keeps its name because it keeps its meaning -- the rows
    of every partition this run produced -- even though a fold payload is
    shaped differently from a holdout one. Which shape it is, is answered by
    asking the splitter that produced it, not by inspecting the payload.

    A session that ran a preprocessing sequence sets two optional fields
    together, ``input_column_refs`` and ``preprocessing_artifacts_path``, as
    the holdout sibling does and for the same reason. Here each entry has a
    fit of its own: fold ``i`` is transformed with ``fold_{i}.pkl`` and the
    trailing entry with ``final.pkl``, which is what keeps a fold from seeing
    statistics fitted on the rows it is scored on.
