# Export a model

A trained model can leave dashAI as a single `.dashai-model` file and be used
from your own Python code, without opening the app or running its server.

## Export

Open a session, click a finished model to open its detail view, and click the
**Export model** button (download icon) next to **Retrain**. The file contains
the trained model, the preprocessing fitted for its session, and the types of
the training columns. It does not contain the dataset.

## Use it from Python

Install dashAI in the environment where you want to predict:

```bash
pip install dashai
```

Then:

```python
from DashAI import load_model
import pandas as pd

model = load_model("my_model.dashai-model")
print(model.info)  # model, task, columns, versions and test metrics

new_rows = pd.read_csv("new_data.csv")
predictions = model.predict(new_rows)
```

`predict` takes a pandas DataFrame or a list of dicts with the **original**
columns of the dataset. Preprocessing is applied for you, and the target
column is ignored if it is present.

## Serving it

dashAI does not include a server for exported models yet. A minimal one with
FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from DashAI import load_model

app = FastAPI()
model = load_model("my_model.dashai-model")


@app.post("/predict")
def predict(rows: list[dict]):
    return {"predictions": model.predict(rows)}
```

## Compatibility

- If the libraries installed differ from the ones the model was trained with,
  dashAI shows a warning and still tries to load it.
- If the model needs a plugin that is not installed, loading fails and the
  error says which one to install.

:::warning
A model file contains Python objects, and loading it runs code. Only load
files from people you trust.
:::

Tabular classification and regression models are tested. Other model types
(images, text, time series) can be exported but are experimental.
